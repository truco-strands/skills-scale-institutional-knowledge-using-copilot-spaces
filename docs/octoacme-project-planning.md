# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Attendees: PM, Product Manager, Developers, QA, Release Manager, Security Lead, Technical Writer, Customer Success Manager (as needed)
   - Review project charter, goals, and success metrics
   - Identify roles and responsibilities
2. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria
   - Product Manager leads prioritization
   - Include security requirements (Security Lead input)
   - Include documentation requirements (Technical Writer input)
   - Include customer impact assessment (Customer Success Manager input)
3. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - Developers provide technical estimates
   - Include time for documentation and security reviews
4. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - Must include code review, testing, security scan, and documentation requirements
5. **Identify dependencies and integration points**
   - Cross-team dependencies
   - External integrations and third-party systems
6. **Create release plan and milestone map**
   - Release Manager defines release strategy and deployment approach
   - Identify release windows and deployment constraints
