# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
**Facilitated by: Project Manager**

- **Timebox**: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- **Attendees**: Core delivery team (PM, Developers, QA), plus Release Manager (for release retros), Security Lead (for security incidents), and other relevant roles as needed
- **Format**: Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- **Prioritization**: Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Documentation**: Technical Writer captures key learnings for knowledge sharing (optional)

## Tracking Improvements
- **Project Manager**: Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- **Project Manager**: Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- **Technical Writer**: Update process documentation based on agreed improvements
- **All role owners**: Report on progress and impact of their action items
